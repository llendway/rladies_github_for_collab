## But I want to learn!

* I want to share code with others so they can use it.  
* I want my code backed up somewhere other than on my computer.  
* I hate keeping track of different versions of code and other files.  
* I also hate the terminal so will try to avoid it at any cost.

Git/Github can help us with this! How many of you already use Github? 


## What we should already have set up


* Created an account on https://github.com/.
* Install and configure git - I have basic instructions here: https://github.com/llendway/github_for_collaboration/blob/master/github_for_collaboration.md#install--configure-git (I'll share this in the chat).  
* Set up a PAT (personal access token) - see the previous link.  
* In R, install the following packages: usethis (for nice interactions with Git/Github), gitcreds (if you haven't yet set up a PAT, there's some functions in here that help) ... I think that's it. I'm going to keep the R code REALLY simple.
