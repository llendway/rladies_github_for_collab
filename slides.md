## But I want to learn!

* I want to share code with others so they can use it.  
* I want my code backed up somewhere other than on my computer.  
* I hate keeping track of different versions of code and other files.  
* I also hate the terminal so will try to avoid it at any cost.

Git/Github can help us with this! How many of you already use Github? 


## What we should already have set up



* Created an account on https://github.com/.
